I have been using Pop!_OS for several months now and I love it. It is very intuitive and user-friendly for the non-Linux user. Every tool I have needed has been available in the Pop Shop and those tools are easy to download, install, and use. Thank you for creating a Linux OS that is simple and approachable.",

Two years later not only am I still using it, it's become my distro-of-choice. It's radically cut how much time I spend hand-hacking configuration files, which gives me more time to spend on my projects.",
